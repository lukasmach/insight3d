insight3d
=========

insight3d lets you create 3D models from photographs. You give it a series of photos of a real scene (e.g., of a building), it automatically matches them and then calculates positions in space from which each photo has been taken (plus camera’s optical parameters) along with a 3D pointcloud of the scene. You can then use insight3d’s modeling tools to create textured polygonal model.

We have a [tutorial available](https://insight3d.sourceforge.net/insight3d_tutorial.pdf).

Also note that some good people have forked insight3d and started the insight3dng project. You might want to check that out.
