// do extrusion on the ordered set of selected vertices
bool tool_extrude_to_ground(double * ground, Selected_Items * selected_vertices, size_t group /*= 0*/)
{
	/* 

	Description
	===========

	Go through all selected vertices and for each create shadow point lying 
	on ground plane. Then create polygons forming the extrusion from ground 
	to selected vertices.

	Specification 
	=============

	1) Create dynamic array of indices. 
	2) Go through all vertices in selection list and for each one create new vertex, 
	   store its index in the dynamic array and position it on the closest point on 
	   the ground plane to the original vertex.
	3) Go once again through all vertices and create polygons connecting 
	   neighbouring vertices and their shadow vertices. 
	4) Finally create polygon between the last and the first applicable vertex in the 
	   list of selected vertices.

	Notes
	=====

	We might want to do extrusion on other set's than current selection list. This 
	function should take a list of vertices as a parameter.
